## Introduction

In hybrid IT environments, where Linux and Windows servers coexist, managing user authentication can be tricky. A centralized auth system ensures simplicity, security, and efficiency by synchronizing user accounts and credentials between systems. 

This project integrated Windows Server 2019 Active Directory (AD) with an OpenLDAP system on CentOS Linux achieving bidirectional user account synchronization and centralized authentication management. 

Key elements include configuring DNS for inter-server communication, setting up Kerberos authentication for secure interaction, and using Samba services to join the Linux server to the AD domain.

## System acrhitecture

### Windows and Linux Server Infrastructure

I used VMware Workstation Pro 2017 virtualization platform with two virtual machines:
| Server | IP | DNS | Services |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| `ADSERVER.local` | `192.168.1.10` | `127.0.0.1` | `Active Directory Domain Services, DNS Server` |
| `openldap.adserver.local` | `192.168.1.20` | `192.168.1.10` | `OpenLDAP 2.4, Samba 4.12, SSSD, Kerberos 5` |

The network configuration uses bridge mode for direct L2 communication between virtual nodes, ensuring low latency and seamless SMB/CIFS protocol operation.

### DNS Hierarchy and Zone Delegation

The Windows DNS server is configured as authoritative for the adserver.local zone, with an explicit A record for the Linux server (openldap.adserver.local â†’ 192.168.1.20). 

The reverse zone for 192.168.1.0/24 enables PTR queries for reverse lookup functionality. 

PowerShell commands for creating zones:
``` powershell title=powershell
Add-DnsServerPrimaryZone -NetworkID "192.168.1.0/24" -ReplicationScope "Forest"
Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name "openldap" -IPv4Address "192.168.1.20"
```

This eliminates dependence on external DNS resolvers and enables dynamic registration of clients through Samba.

## Configuring Windows Active Directory
### Initial Procedure for Promotion to DC

After the basic installation of Windows Server I promoted the server to a Domain Controller with the new forest, adserver.local. 

The functionality of AD can be verified through the Active Directory Users and Computers console, where test users (e.g., "Marko," "Darko") were created.

## Linux OpenLDAP and Samba Integration
### Basic OpenLDAP Installation Procedure

```bash
yum install -y openldap-servers openldap-clients sssd samba samba-client
```

1. **slapd.conf**:
```text
database mdb
suffix "dc=adserver,dc=local"
rootdn "cn=admin,dc=adserver,dc=local"
rootpw {SSHA}...
```

The slappasswd tool was used to generate the hashed administrator password.

2. **LDAP Schema Import**:
```bash
ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.ldif
```

3. **Basic Organizational Unit**:
```text
dn: ou=People,dc=adserver,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: People
```

Kerberos authentication was configured through /etc/krb5.conf, directing KDC requests to the Windows Server.

## Samba as AD Domain Member
Samba configuration in /etc/samba/smb.conf focused on the LDAP backend and AD integration:

```text
[global]
   workgroup = ADSERVER
   security = ads
   realm = ADSERVER.LOCAL
   idmap config * : backend = tdb
   idmap config * : range = 3000-7999
   winbind use default domain = yes
```
The domain joining process was performed with the command:

```bash
net ads join -U Administrator
```
Validation of successful joining was verified through wbinfo -u, which displays users from AD.

## User Account Synchronization
### Bidirectional Attribute Replication
Using the ldapsearch and ldapmodify, the synchronization of user entities was proven:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ADSERVER.adserver.local -b "dc=adserver,dc=local"
```

```text
dn: uid=marko,ou=People,dc=adserver,dc=local
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uid: marko
sn: Markovic
givenName: Marko
mail: marko@adserver.local
userPassword: {SSHA}...
```
The Samba smbldap-tools enabled automatic mapping of SIDs from AD to UNIX UID/GID values, using the idmap_rid mechanism.

## Security Aspects and Authentication Protocols
### Kerberos TGS Exchange Process
Kerberos auth testing:

```bash
kinit administrator@ADSERVER.LOCAL
klist
```
The output shows a successfully obtained TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)

### SASL/GSSAPI Integration
OpenLDAP was configured to support the GSSAPI mechanism through olcSaslSecProps parameters in the cn=config DIT:

```text
olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=112
```
This enables encrypted LDAP communication using Kerberos tickets.

## Alternative Approaches and Problems
### FreeIPA Integration Attempts
The experiment with FreeIPA showed the possibility of LDAP synchronization through the ipa-replica-manage tool, but the configuration complexity and manual management of ldif files were identified as major drawbacks compared to the Samba solution.

### Errors in DNS Configuration
Initial problems with reverse zones were resolved by adding explicit PTR records and checking the nslookup tool. Example fix:

```powershell
Add-DnsServerResourceRecordPtr -Name "20" -PtrDomainName "openldap.adserver.local"
```

## Performance and System Testing
### Measuring Authentication Latency
Using the time command during the kinit operation, the average time to issue a TGT was 120ms on the local network, which corresponds to expectations for a 1 Gbps environment.
